#This program demonstrates various ways to
#use functions in Python

#The main function
def main():
    welcome_message()  #causes welcome_message to run
    goodbye_message()   #cause goodbye message to run

#This function is to welcome people to my program
def welcome_message():
    print ('Welcome to my program using functions')
    print ('My name is Joe Student')

#This function says goodbye
def goodbye_message():
    print ('Thanks for stopping by')
    print ('Have a nice day')

#This is the main function that starts the program in #motion
main()   #calls main
